# Format of this file:
#
#  - First we have the "tagsonomy", a tree of tags used to categorize the projects.
#  - After that is "projects", a list of awesome projects
#
# Each project has the following format:
#
#  - name: Project Name
#    repo_url: github or bitbucket or other web link to code
#    wp_url: Wikipedia URL if there is one
#    docs_url: URL to docs
#    home_url: Home page if not one of the above
#    tags: ["", ""]  # see full taxonomy elsewhere in this file
#    desc: Handy project designed for handiness
#
# Only the name, repo_url, tags, and description are required.
#
# In the description, avoid references to Python, free/open-source, and
# the app name itself, since those are already present/implied by being
# on the list.
